</ol>
<b>Installation Video</b>
<br/>
Here is a link to an video showing the installation of the theme and the importing of demo content: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heHlFAb0x_4" rel="nofollow">INSTALLATION VIDEO</a><div class="note"><b>Congratulations you have now successfully installed the Form Theme</b></div>
<h2><a name="sec1_3">1.3</a> Theme Installation Errors</h2>
<br/>
<div class="alert">Do not upload the Themeforest download package directly to your WordPress site, because this will lead to errors. Make sure to Unzip this package and inside you will find the theme zip archive: <b>Form.theme.zip</b>. This is what you will need to upload to your WordPress installation</div>
<br/>
<b>If you upload / Install the Form theme and you get one of the following errors, then you have forgotten to unzip the download package.</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>This theme is invalid<br/>

	<li>This theme is missing a style.css</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec2_0">2</a> Theme Setup<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>Before you start using the Form theme, a few setup steps are required. This section will walk you through these steps.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec2_1">2.1</a> Importing Demo Content</h2>
<br/>
Some buyers like to install their theme and have it look exactly like the Themeforest preview site. If this is something you would like to do, then follow the steps in this section. This step is optional so feel free to skip it. The subsequent sections will provide all the instructions you need to insert your own content manually.<div class="note">The dummy content inserted in this step will not contain the beautiful images seen in the Themeforest.net demo. These images cannot be included because they are commercial images, which we have purchased for theme demonstration only and we do not have a redistribution license for these assets.</div><b>To Import Demo Content</b><div class="note">Make sure to install and activate the Form theme before importing any demo content.</div><img src="shots/Import Demo Content.png" alt="[Import%20Demo%20Content.png]" title="" /> 
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Install and activate the Form theme. (See section above)<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Go to the Form theme options <i>Appearance &gt; Theme Options</i>
	</li>
	<li>The <b>General</b> tab should be open by default, but if not click it to show the general options.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The very first section in the <b>General</b> is the demo Content import section.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click the large green <i>Import Demo Content</i> button once only.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The theme will now import our demo content into you site. A progress bar will inform you of the import processes progress.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>This importer will basically import posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, sidebars, widgets, menus and all configuration from our preview content export file.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">Please note that dummy images will be used instead of the premium image assets we have used in our online preview.</div><div class="alert"><b>Alert 2</b> If you already have content in your site, you will be asked to confirm the import, but if your site is a fresh installation of WordPress, there will be no confirmation request. Importing demo content will not overwrite existing content such as posts or pages, but it will replace all sidebar and widget configuration. So please be aware of this before you decide to do this process.</div>
<h1><a name="sec3_0">3</a> Theme Structure - How It Works<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The Form theme is essentially a multi-page theme with each of its pages being made up of one or mode sections. These sections are inserted, arranged and filled with content vis the &quot;Content Builder&quot; page template. To construct these pages you need to follow these steps:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Create a page using the &quot;Pages&quot; main WP menu item.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the page attributes box on the right hand side, select the &quot;Content Builder&quot; page template.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The WP editor will disappear and be replaced with the visual content builder. 
	</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Add Block&quot; to open the list of all possible modules.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select which one you wish to add and fill out all of its fields/options.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>More blocks can be added to the layout in the same way. See the Content Builder section for an explanation of all blocks and their associated options.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Finally publish the page.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec4_0">4</a> Custom Thumb Cropping<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1><img src="shots/thumbnail.crop.png" alt="[thumbnail.crop.png]" title="" />
<br/>
The Form theme contains a custom thumbnail cropping feature. This feature is most useful if you want to control how your large images are cropped when they are for example shown in your portfolio grid. With this feature you can control exactly how the thumbnails are created from your larger images.<br/>
To use this feature go to: <b>Media &gt; Library</b> in the main WordPress menu. Now select any image from the library, an image used in your projects would be most suitable. On the main attachment page, scroll down until you see the dialog box entitled: &quot;Thumbnails&quot;. To define a custom crop for a thumbnail, do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>This dialog will contain all of the thumbnail version of this attachment which have been auto-generated by the theme for use in those areas you have inserted this image. If this image features in many areas of the theme, or has done at some stage, but was replaced, this dialog may contain numerous thumbnails. 
	</li>
	<li>Find the thumbnail which corresponds with the size of the thumbnail in your portfolio page (which you wish to re-crop). You may need to check the size of that image in your portfolio grid page. You can do this with an element inspector which is built into most modern browsers. Use it by right clicking once you are hovering the image, then select &quot;Inspect Element&quot; from the context menu. Now you should be able to find the image size in the panels which appear.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Once you have found the thumb you are looking for, click it in the dialog. This will open the thumb cropping control, hiding all other thumbs in the process.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>With your mouse you can now resize and reposition the cropping frame in the window on the left. Once the position has changed you will see a preview of the resulting thumbnail in the window on the right.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>When you have found a suitable crop for this thumbnail, click the &quot;Save&quot; button. The crop control will close and the other thumbs will reappear. 
	</li>
	<li>Now refresh your portfolio grid page to view the updated thumbnail. Remember to clear your browser cache, otherwise the updated thumbnail may not appear.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">Once thumb cropping has been altered, the browser cache should be cleared before viewing the page which contains the updated thumbnail.</div>
<h1><a name="sec5_0">5</a> Creating Posts<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The Form theme contains 3 different post formats - Standard, Video and Gallery.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec5_1">5.1</a> Common Options</h2>
<br/>
The following option is common to all post types.<br/>
<table><tr><td class="option">Background Image</td><td class="value">Enter the image here which will appear in the full width header area on the single post page.<td></tr><tr><td class="option">Alternate Splash</td><td class="value">By default the full width splash area on each page automatically get the title of the page in large white writing.

<h2><a name="sec5_2">5.2</a> Custom Metaboxes</h2>
<br/>
Form supports several post formats, some of them like <i>Video</i> or <i>Gallery</i> require additional configuration parameters which can be set in the Metabox Area, under the post/page content editor. Each time a Post Format is selected, the page updates and only the Metaboxes relevant to the current selections will be shown.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec5_3">5.3</a> Post Format: Standard</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts an optional featured image. To insert this featured image do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>In the Featured Image box, click <i>Set featured Image</i>
	</li>
	<li>This will open the WP media loader. Select the image you wish to use for the featured image. The resolution should be large, minimum of 1000px wide and the pixelentity framework will auto-generate the size required for the post. ( The image should be optimized for web and devices and should have a file size generally less that 300kb. The smaller the file size the better, as long as the image quality is not compromised. )<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Once the image is loaded ensure the <i>original size</i> is selected and click the <i>Set as Featured Image</i> button.<br/>
	</li>
	<li> Close the media uploader window and publish your post.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec5_4">5.4</a> Post Format: Video</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts a custom video post type as its media content. To insert this video do the following:<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Scroll down the page to the <i>Video Options</i> Metabox. There you will find a drop menu containing the list of all the custom video post types which have been created.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the video you wish to feature in this post.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You can also add a featured image to this post. If one is added it will become the cover image for the video item. If no featured image is entered, the video item will attempt to load its default cover image generated by YouTube or Vimeo, depending on which service you are using. 
	</li>
	<li> Now publish the post.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">It should be noted that if  you are using the auto cover image fetching method. The theme will only be able to fetch this image is the original video uploader has permitted it. This is usually permitted by default except for videos marked &quot;private&quot;. If the video is private, no image will be loaded.</div><div class="alert">In order for a video to appear in the list, it first needs to be created. See the section on <b>Creating A Video</b> for more information.</div>
<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec5_5">5.5</a> Post Format: Gallery</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts a custom gallery post type as its media content. To insert this gallery do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Scroll down the page to the <i>Gallery</i> box. There you will find a drop menu containing the list of all the custom gallery post types which have been created.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the gallery you wish to feature in this post.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Underneath the list of galleries you can specify the width and height of the desired gallery. These values may mean that your images will be cropped in order to achieve the entered dimensions. The extend of the cropping depends on the image&#39;s original aspect ratio. To avoid cropping of the images leave these fields blank and the gallery will be sized to fit its content / container.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert">In order for a gallery to appear in the list, it first needs to be created. See the section on <b>Creating A Gallery</b> for more information.</div><div class="note">In this theme all gallery posts will display their content as a slider.</div>
<h1><a name="sec6_0">6</a> Creating a Gallery<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The Form theme features a Gallery custom post type. This can be found in the main WP admin menu <i>Galleries</i>. All gallery type posts and portfolio items will need to have their gallery content created first using this custom post type. Once it has been created here it will be available to be inserted into those areas.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec6_1">6.1</a> Direct Upload Gallery</h2>
<br/>
This type of gallery is most suited for when the images you want to display are not already uploaded to your WordPress installation, it will present you with a big &quot;Drop Files Here&quot; area into which you can just drag and drop images from your hard drive. The gallery will take care of everything and, once the upload process is done, you can just save/publish. The image order can be manually altered by dragging thumbs to suit your needs.<br/>
<br>
<b>To create a Direct Upload Gallery do the following:</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Select the <i>Galleries</i> item in the main admin menu &amp; select &quot;Add New&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the <i>Gallery</i>box, select &quot;Direct upload&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Drag and drop your images into the <i>Upload Gallery Images</i> section&#39;s drop zone with the dashed outline.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>These images will now load and appear below the drop zone in the <i>Gallery Content</i> area as thumbnails.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may drag these thumbnails to reorganize the sequence of images if this is important.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may also add an optional featured image to the gallery post. This will be used as the cover for the gallery post in certain configurations.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now click <i>Publish</i> to publish this gallery post. This type of post is mostly used to provide content for another post or portfolio project. The post may also be viewed in it&#39;s own page however by clicking the <i>View Post</i> button.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec6_2">6.2</a> Gallery Image Display Options</h2>
<br/>
The Form theme contains one single display option - Slider. 
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li><b>Slider:</b> The content of the gallery will be displayed as slider. There are no additional options for this mode.<div class="note">However a gallery single page will display the gallery images in a grid format. When these times are clicked a larger version of the image will open in a popup lightbox viewer. To see the single gallery page, once you have created and published a gallery, click the &quot;view page&quot; button located beside the gallery&#39;s permalink.</div></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec6_3">6.3</a> Media Tags</h2>
<br/>
The WordPress media library doesn&#39;t allow you to categorize attachments/images in any way besides the upload date. For this reason, in our framework, we have introduced a feature called &quot;Media Tags&quot;. Media Tags work exactly like regular &quot;Tags&quot; do for posts: each image can be assigned one or more tags which can then be used to group similar/related images.The media library admin page has been expanded to allow easy media tags management and image filter by tag.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec6_4">6.4</a> Media Tags Gallery</h2>
<br/>
When WordPress media library is already filled with some images, you can categorize them by using media tags. Once you have created one or more media tags, you can use them to create a gallery. Unlike the direct upload case, the gallery will now show a list of all existing media tags: by selecting one (or more) tag from the list (and clicking the refresh button), all the images assigned to those tag will be automatically added to the gallery. Since the same tags can be used in multiple galleries, you don&#39;t need to upload the same image multiple times in order for it to appear in different places. Whenever you assign additional images to a media tag, every galleries making use of these tags will also update its content automatically.<br/>
<br>
See a video of this process in action: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B16L2AFOUxE" rel="nofollow">MEDIA TAGS VIDEO</a>
<br/>
<br>
<b>To create a Media Tags Gallery do the following:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Select the <i>Galleries</i> item in the main admin menu &amp; select &quot;Add New&quot;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the <i>Gallery Options</i>box select &quot;Media tags (Any)&quot; or &quot;Media Tags (All)&quot;. For an explanation of media tags see the Media Tags section above.<ul>
			<li><b>Any</b> will includes all the images matching at least one of the selected media tags. 
			</li>
			<li><b>All</b> will include all the images matching all the selected media tags.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select one or more <i>Media Tags</i> from the list<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click <i>Refresh</i> button<br/>
	</li>
	<li>These images will now load and appear below the drop zone in the <i>Gallery Content</i> area as thumbnails.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may drag these thumbnails to reorganize the sequence of images in the Gallery if this is important.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may also add an optional featured image to the gallery post. This will be used as the cover for the gallery post in certain configurations.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now click <i>Publish</i> to publish this gallery post. This post will not appear in your website. This type of post is only used to provide content for another post or portfolio project. The post may be viewed in it&#39;s own page however by clicking the <i>View Post</i> button.</li>

<b>To create a video custom post do the following:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Select the <i>Videos</i> item in the main admin menu &amp; select &quot;Add New&quot;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the <i>Video Options</i>box select what type of video you would like to create.The options are <b>Youtube</b> and <b>Vimeo</b>
	</li>
	<li>In both video types, you just need to insert the url of the online video into the <i>Video URL</i> field.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select whether the video will play fullscreen using the &quot;Play Fullscreen&quot; option.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Set the max-width of the video when it is played in fullscreen mode.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Finally, click <i>Publish</i> to publish your video custom post type. This post will not immediately appear in your website. This type of post is normally used to provide content for another post or portfolio project. However the post may be viewed in it&#39;s own page by clicking the <i>View Post</i> button.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">When inserting the video url, make sure the url does not include &quot;https&quot; but should simply be &quot;http&quot;, because this can prevent the video from being loaded correctly. Also make sure that the video&#39;s url is the full url and not some kind of shortened/abbreviated url eg. http://youtu.be/... because this can also stop the video from loading.</div>

In this tab you can specify Google Web Typefaces to be used in various parts of the theme.For each elements listed below you can choose any front from the Google Web Font library. Once you have chosen a font from the list, you will see a preview of this font immediately beneath the list box. Icons will appear on the right hand side of the preview. These icons indicate what font weights are available for that chosen typeface. The Icons are as follows:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li><b>R</b> -- Regular<br/>
	</li>
	<li><b>B</b> -- Bold<br/>
	</li>
	<li><b>I</b> -- Italics<br/>
	</li>
	<li><b>BI</b> -- Bold Italics</li>
</ol>
When deciding what font to use, ensure that the chosen font contains the font weight required by the element in the theme, where it is being applied. For example, All main headings are bold, so you need to select a new font for these elements which supports a bold font weight. If you select a font which does not have a bold icon, the font will not be applied.

<h1><a name="sec12_0">12</a> Widgetized Areas &amp; Inserting Widgets<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1><div class="note">If you have imported the demo content supplied with this theme, then this setup will be already done. In which case you may only need to modify things. However we still recommend that you read this section carefully because it contains important information which will be useful during modification of the imported widget configuration.</div>The Form theme features support for unlimited widget area. There is 1 widgetized areas in this theme: The sidebar. Because of the unlimited widget area support in this theme, you can insert a unique sidebar into each and every page which used the &quot;Blog&quot; page template. This is very easy to setup and you will be taken through this process in the rest of this section.<div class="note">Please note once a sidebar is assigned to a blog page, all posts on that blog page will display the same sidebar. There is no option to specify a different sidebar on a post by post basis.</div>

<h2><a name="sec12_3">12.3</a> Placing Your widgetized Area Into The Theme</h2>
<br/>
Once you have filled your widget area with your desired widgets, you will still need to tell the theme on which posts you would like to display this widget area. To do this see the following:<br/>
<br>
<b>To Insert The Widget Area as a Sidebar:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>On some pages you will see on the right hand side below the &quot;tags&quot; box, an additional content boxes entitled <b>Sidebar</b>.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>This boxes allow you to select which widget area is to be used specifically on that post for the sidebar. This may be different for each and every page template. Some templates do not support sidebars, in this case no sidebar selection box will appear on that page.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec13_0">13</a> The Main Menu<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The Form theme contains 1 menu locations, the <b>Main Menu</b>. This menu does not support any sub levels of menu items. In this section we will outline the steps involved in creating the menu for this theme.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec13_1">13.1</a> Creating A Menu</h2><div class="note">Before you create your menu for this theme, make sure your pages/sections have been created already. This way they will be available to be inserted into the menu.</div><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<br>
<br/>

<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

	</li>
	<li>At the top left of that page you will see a panel titled <i>Theme Locations</i>
	</li>
	<li>Here there will be a select box under the two available locations in the Form theme.These select boxes will hold a list of all created menus.<br/>

</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec14_0">14</a> Shortcodes<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>This theme contains several useful shortcodes. These are basically helper codes which can be inserted into the default WordPress editor and when the page is rendered they will become full elements. The type of element depends on the type of shortcode used. Shortcodes are available for inserting videos buttons and columns. In this section we will list these available shortcodes and the properties or parameters associated with each one. 
<br/>
To insert a shortcode simply click the <i>Insert Shortcode</i> button in the toolbar area of the default WordPress editor.<br/>
<br>
<img src="shots/Shortcode Button.png" alt="[Shortcode%20Button.png]" title="" />
<b>^ The Shortcode Icon seen above in blue &quot;SC&quot; on right end of the icons in the toolbar.</b><div class="note">It should be noted that it is not sufficient to copy and paste a shortcode&#39;s short syntax from one page/post/theme&#39;s editor window to another. To be inserted correctly each shortcode needs to be inserted using the shortcode editor. If this process is not followed, the page will not render correctly and the layout will not look as expected.</div><b>To Add a Shortcode do the following:</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Position the cursor in the editor in the specific position where you wish to place the shortcode or element.<br/>
	</li>

	</li>
	<li>When you are ready, click <i>Insert Shortcode</i> the editor will then close and you will see the shortcode appear in the editor window.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<br>
<table><tr><td class="option">Use Video</td><td class="value">Select the video from the drop list which you would like to insert.<td></tr></table>
<h1><a name="sec15_0">15</a> Fonts<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The Form theme uses Google web fonts by default. These fonts are as follows:<br/>
<br>
<table><tr><td class="option">General Font</td><td class="value">Lato (Sans Serif)<td></tr><tr><td class="option">Heading Font</td><td class="value">Montserrat (Sans Serif)<td></tr></table>If you wish to make changes to these fonts you have the following options:<br/>

</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec16_0">16</a> Theme Translation<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The only method to translate this theme is Using a POT file.<br/>
<br>
A POT file is a simple method but it is designed to basically translate the theme&#39;s static text content into one other language. For example this would be used when the theme was designed to be used in English, but your website will be in Italian or another language, and you would like to translate all the parts of the theme which are not the content you will be writing. This would included back end translation such as admin field names, descriptions etc, as well as front end static text which is visible to the visitor. These front end items would included things like contact from field names, comment section titles, other titles which appear automatically rather then being actually entered by you. This method is not designed to handle language switching in your website. If you require this more advanced functionality, you will need to use a plugin. No specific plugins have been tested with this theme, and hence we cannot guarantee that they will work.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec16_1">16.1</a> Translation Using POT File</h2>
<br/>
To translate the theme using the POT file do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Create a po file for your language, for example <b>de_DE.po</b>
	</li>
	<li>Copy all text from provided theme pot file into your po file<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Edit the po file with <b>poedit</b> <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poedit.net/</a>
	</li>
	<li>Create the mo file<br/>
	</li>
	<li>edit <i>wp-config.php</i> file in your installation and set <b>WPLANG</b> so it matches your languages: <b>define(&#39;WPLANG&#39;, &#39;de_DE&#39;);</b>
	</li>
	<li>The Theme should now display all messages in your language.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert"><b>BACKUP YOUR LANGUAGE PO/MO FILES</b> 
Upon theme update, language files are <b>NOT</b> preserved. 
You will need to manually restore your po/mo files right after the update.</div>
<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec16_2">16.2</a> Modifying The theme&#39;s CSS</h2>
<br/>
The Custom CSS field provided in the Form theme&#39;s theme options panel should be used for making changes to the theme&#39;s CSS styles. This can be found in <i>Appearance&gt;Theme Options&gt;General&gt;Custom CSS</i>.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<b>To overwrite an elements CSS styles:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Locate the element&#39;s CSS selector using firebug or chrome&#39;s element inspector.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Copy this selector and paste it into the Custom CSS Field found in the theme&#39;s custom options &quot;General&quot; tab.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Add your new styles and you are done.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click Save All Changes at the bottom of the theme options page.<br/>
		<br/>
		Now the theme&#39;s default CSS will be overwritten by what you have entered into the Custom CSS box.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec17_0">17</a> Javascript<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>
<h2><a name="sec17_1">17.1</a> Adding Custom Javascript</h2>
<br/>
Similar to the Custom CSS filed in the theme options, there is also a Custom Javascript field to be used when you wish to insert additional javascript into the theme. The only difference with this field is that the javascript code placed here will not overwrite any existing javascript code. An example of custom javascript code which would be used in this field is Google Analytics. Simply paste in the javascript code provided by Google in this box, save and you&#39;re done.<br/>
<h1><a name="sec18_0">18</a> Rebranding the Custom Admin Panel<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>As many of our buyers are buying our themes in order to sell to their clients, we have decided to aid this process by designing our theme&#39;s custom admin panel to be easily rebranded. Our theme&#39;s custom options panel contains a secret option which allows our buyers to rebrand the admin panel with their logo and and afterwards these options disappear. This allows our buyers who provide their clients with themes which strengthen their brand identity with their clients and which don&#39;t force cross links to the pixelentity brand.<br/>
<br>
<img src="shots/branding.jpg" alt="[branding.jpg]" title="" data-spots="1:100:290,2:206:429,3:520:295,4:520:464" />
<br/>
<b>To rebrand the admin panel do the following:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Navigate to the theme options page. <i>Appearance &gt; Theme Options</i> <div class="hotspot-link">1</div>
	</li>
	<li>In the browser address bar, add the following query string to the end of the existing url and hit enter.<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nt">branding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">1</span>
		</pre></div>
	</li>
	<li>A new tab will appear in the Theme Options page named <i>Branding</i> <div class="hotspot-link">2</div> The contents of this tab is shown in the above screenshot.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Here <div class="hotspot-link">3</div> you can set an image to be used as the logo/ branding for the custom admin panel. You can also set a custom url which will be attached to the logo image.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>To see the changes, click save <div class="hotspot-link">4</div> remove the query string from the url and reload the page.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The branding tab should now be hidden again and the new logo visible.</li>
